 The GCD of 35 and 15 is 5
Coefficients x and y are: x = 1, y = -2
Verification: 35*1 + 15*-2 = 5

The GCD of 240 and 46 is 2
Coefficients x and y are: x = -9, y = 47
Verification: 240*-9 + 46*47 = 2
------------------------------

Testing with a = 48, b = 18:
GCD(48, 18) = 6
Coefficients: x = -1, y = 3
Verification (48*x + 18*y == gcd): 48*-1 + 18*3 = 6 (Expected: 6)
Verification check passed: True
```
